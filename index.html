        <h1>The Project</h1>
        <p>Geck will be developped for both iOS and Android devices. First-time users open the app when they are commuting to work. The app will then register their route. The user will do the same thing when they drive from their office to home. The app will use that information to match 3, 4 or 5 users that have similar commutes. They will be matched based on the time they leave, their work location, where they stop for a meal.</p>

        <h1>Benefits</h1>
        <p>This project will have multiple benefits that positively affect the climate, communities, road traffic and the economy.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Users of the app will get a break from driving everyday</li>
        	<li>There will be less cars on the road as commuters will be sharing cars</li>
        	<li>Less cars means less CO2 emession</li>
        	<li>People from the same community will meet each. This enables community bonding</li>
